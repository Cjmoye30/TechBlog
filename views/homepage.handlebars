{{!-- This page should show all of the posts by the different users AFTER they are logged in --}}
{{!-- We can populate our database with random educational facts about tech - EASY --}}
{{!-- Once logged in, the API for the homepage will get all blog posts --}}
{{!-- the database can have just one table which stores all of the blog posts by all of the users - then if we would
ever want to query by a single user, then we can pass that into the url --}}
